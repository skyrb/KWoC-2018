## About KWoc (Kharagpur Winter Of Code)
Kharagpur Winter of Code is a 5-week long online programme for students who are new to open source software development or want to be
more confident about contributing to open source projects.KWoC provides a great opportunity to get acquainted with Github along with 
Git commands and contribute to open source efficiently.If you love coding and want to learn about software development then KWoC helps
you to get a glimpse of it and gives you a head start.

## Projects
There were many projects to choose from that belonged to various fields of computer science like Android Development, Data Analysis,
Deep Learning, Web Development etc. I contributed to two projects that were based on data analysis and deep learning that are described
below beiefly.

1. [ANONS: Analysis of Variance for Neural Networks](https://github.com/nishnik/ANONS)
    The task was to perform ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) on neural networks to measure the effect of different hyperparameters
    on performance and the interactions among the hyperparameters. A basic MNIST digit classification dataset and CIFAR10 image 
    dataset were used to make neural network model on which the above mentioned statistical test was performed. The basic workflow
    is as follow:
    1. Creating a baseline model on dataset given.
    2. Training the model with different hyperparameters for fixed no. of epochs and logging the accuracy for each epoch in a 
       markdown file. 
    3. Collecting plots of validation error vs epochs in a folder.
    4. Performing Analysis of variance using python.
